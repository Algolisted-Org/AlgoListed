## About

Welcome to the Algorithmist, a website dedicated to exploring the world of algorithms and data structures. Algorithmist is an open source, educational website for coders.  We are building a community where you can learn and sharpen your data structure skills.  Data structures and algorithms can be difficult, so learning in a community can be one of the best ways to master these techniques.

On our site, you will find a variety of resources and tutorials on topics ranging from basic algorithms to advanced data structures and algorithms. Whether you are a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced developer looking to improve your skills, we have something for everyone.

We are constantly working to improve and expand our website, so be sure to check back
often for new content and updates. We hope you enjoy your time on our site and that you
find it helpful and informative.

## Tech Stack
This project is created with MERN stack.  A few third party APIs and services are used, such as the Google Spread Sheet APIs, Firebase for deployment, and Cyclic for the backend.

Frontend hosted on Firebase : https://algorithmist-dev.web.app/

API hosted on cyclic.sh : https://algolisted.cyclic.app/

<b>Module 1 : </b>  Beginner level blogs with open-sourced content and questions, etc. (Edit Request) <br/><br/>
<b>Module 2 : </b>  Private API open-ended for all coding-related competitions driven by users' given information. <br/><br/>
<b>Module 3 : </b>  Coding Sheets - Since now, in the market we have a bunch of SDE sheets here you get a single place to choose whichever one suits you the most. The discussion section which will be added soon will let you prepare for the potholes while solving a particular sheet. One of the best features we are planning to add is a detailed analysis just like monkeytype. <br/><br/>
<b>Module 4 : </b>  List notes, codes, and other resources that are related to a particular youtube educator like Striver, Tourist, Priyansh Agarwal, Code with Harry, Love Babbar, Kunal Kushwaha, Anuj Bhaiya, Luv, etc. This would significantly increase the productivity of the students who want to learn from a particular playlist of videos.  <br/><br/>
<b>Module 5 : </b>  Selected profiles page - Students who got selected by a particular company can post on this page their resume and other coding profiles, and users can see what kind of profiles they need to build in order to get selected in a particular category of companies.  <br/><br/>
<b>Module 6 : </b>  Private API open-ended for all off-campus opportunities driven by users' given information. (Might not work on this for now). <br/><br/>
